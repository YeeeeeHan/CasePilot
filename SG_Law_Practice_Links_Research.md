# **Procedural Rigour and Evidentiary Standards in Singapore Civil Litigation: A Comprehensive Practice Report**

## **1\. Introduction: The Paradigm Shift in Civil Procedure**

The administration of civil justice in Singapore has undergone a tectonic shift with the implementation of the Rules of Court 2021 (ROC 2021). This regulatory overhaul represents more than a mere update of timelines or forms; it signifies a fundamental philosophical transition from a party-driven adversarial system to a court-led, justice-centric model. For the legal practitioner, understanding the scope of evidence, the preparation of affidavits, and the technicalities of filing is no longer just a matter of rote compliance—it requires a deep appreciation of the five "Ideals" that now govern the interpretation of every rule and practice direction.

The ROC 2021 was designed to address the increasing complexity of modern litigation, where the sheer volume of electronic evidence and the intricacies of cross-border disputes threatened to overwhelm the traditional mechanisms of justice. By harmonizing the practice directions across the Supreme Court, State Courts, and Family Justice Courts, the judiciary has created a unified procedural framework. However, this unity does not imply simplicity. The requirements for the admission of evidence, the specific formatting of affidavits, and the rigid technical specifications of the eLitigation platform remain exacting.

This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the evidentiary landscape in Singapore. It dissects the statutory requirements of the _Evidence Act 1893_, the procedural mandates of the Supreme Court and State Courts Practice Directions 2021, and the specialized rules governing family proceedings. Furthermore, it integrates a detailed technical guide to the electronic filing ecosystem, ensuring that the practitioner is equipped not only with the legal knowledge to argue admissibility but also with the practical know-how to ensure that their documents are accepted by the Registry.

### **1.1 The Five Ideals: The Interpretative Lens**

Every procedural step taken by a lawyer in Singapore must now be measured against the five Ideals set out in Order 3, Rule 1 of the ROC 2021\. These are not aspirational statements but operative principles that courts use to exercise their powers.1

| Ideal                                | Implication for Evidence and Affidavits                                                                                                                                          |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fair Access to Justice**           | Evidence must be disclosed fully and frankly. Surprise tactics are discouraged. Hearsay notices must be filed promptly to allow the opposing party to verify the source.         |
| **Expeditious Proceedings**          | Timelines for filing Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (AEICs) are strict. Late filing of supplementary affidavits is often rejected unless "special cases" are proven.            |
| **Cost-Effective Work**              | The volume of evidence must be proportionate to the claim value. Courts may limit the number of witnesses or the length of affidavits to prevent "paper wars."                   |
| **Efficient Use of Court Resources** | Applications to adduce evidence must be made at the Single Application Pending Trial (SAPT) stage to avoid multiple hearings.                                                    |
| **Fair and Practical Results**       | Technical non-compliance (e.g., margin errors) may be rectified if it does not prejudice the other party, but substantive failures (e.g., lack of personal knowledge) are fatal. |

The court’s commitment to these ideals is evident in recent decisions where late applications to adduce hearsay evidence were rejected because doing so would derail the trial timeline, thus violating the ideal of expeditious proceedings, even if the evidence was potentially relevant.1

## **2\. The Statutory Bedrock: The Evidence Act 1893**

While the Rules of Court govern _how_ evidence is presented, the _Evidence Act 1893_ (EA) governs _what_ can be presented. It is a codified system of inclusion—evidence is admissible only if it falls within the specific provisions of the Act.3

### **2.1 The Concept of Relevancy**

The EA distinguishes between "facts in issue" and "relevant facts." A fact in issue is a fact that a party must prove to establish their claim or defence (e.g., that a contract was signed). A relevant fact is one that renders the existence of a fact in issue probable or improbable (e.g., a motive to breach the contract).4

Section 6 of the EA embodies the doctrine of _res gestae_, allowing evidence of facts that form part of the "same transaction" as the fact in issue. This is crucial in civil fraud or conspiracy cases where individual acts, seemingly innocent in isolation, become relevant when viewed as part of a continuous sequence of events.4

### **2.2 The Exclusionary Rule: Hearsay Evidence**

One of the most complex areas of Singapore evidentiary law is the treatment of hearsay. Hearsay is defined as an assertion made out of court, tendered in court to prove the truth of the matter asserted.5 The general rule is exclusion: a witness cannot testify about what someone else said if the purpose is to prove that the statement is true.

#### **2.2.1 Statutory Exceptions (Section 32\)**

The rigor of the hearsay rule is mitigated by Section 32 of the EA, which permits hearsay evidence in specific circumstances where the maker of the statement is unavailable or where the reliability of the statement is inherent in the context of its making.6

| Subsection     | Category of Statement       | Condition for Admissibility                                                                                                                           |
| :------------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **s 32(1)(b)** | Ordinary Course of Business | Statements made in the routine of trade, profession, or occupation (e.g., a clerk's entry in a ledger).                                               |
| **s 32(1)(c)** | Against Interest            | Statements that are against the pecuniary or proprietary interest of the maker (assumed to be true because people rarely lie to their own detriment). |
| **s 32(1)(j)** | Unavailable Maker           | The maker is dead, cannot be found, is outside Singapore, or is mentally/physically incapable of testifying.                                          |

#### **2.2.2 Procedural Safeguards and Notices**

Admissibility under Section 32 is not automatic. The ROC 2021 and Practice Directions impose a strict notice regime to prevent "trial by ambush."

- **Notice Requirement:** A party intending to rely on hearsay evidence must serve a notice on the other party.
- **Prescribed Forms:** The Supreme Court Practice Directions prescribe **Form B13A** for documentary hearsay and **Form B13B** for non-documentary hearsay.7 These forms require the proponent to detail the substance of the statement and the specific subsection of Section 32 relied upon.
- **Objections:** The opposing party must file a counter-notice if they object to the admissibility. If they fail to do so, the evidence may be admitted by consent. However, the court retains the ultimate discretion to exclude evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.3

### **2.3 Opinion Evidence and Expert Witnesses**

The general rule is that witnesses must testify to facts, not opinions. Section 47 of the EA provides the exception for expert opinion.

- **The "Substantial Assistance" Test:** Unlike the older "necessity" test, the current standard is whether the expert opinion provides "substantial assistance" to the court in understanding evidence that requires scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge.9
- **Common Knowledge Exclusion:** If the court can form its own conclusion based on the facts (e.g., whether a driver was negligent based on speed and road conditions), expert opinion is inadmissible.9
- **Format of Expert Evidence:** Experts are not merely witnesses for a party; they owe a paramount duty to the court. Their reports must follow **Form B7 (Expert Witness Template)**, which likely includes declarations of independence and a statement of truth.7

### **2.4 Privilege and Public Policy**

The EA codifies legal professional privilege (LPP) to encourage full and frank communication between clients and lawyers.

- **Advice Privilege (s 128):** Protects confidential communications made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.
- **Litigation Privilege:** Protects communications made when litigation is in reasonable prospect, provided the dominant purpose was for the litigation.6
- **Exceptions:** Privilege is absolute unless waived, but it does not protect communications made in furtherance of an illegal purpose or fraud.3 This "fraud exception" is a powerful tool in commercial fraud litigation, allowing parties to pierce the veil of privilege if they can make a prima facie case of wrongdoing.

## **3\. The Architecture of Affidavits: Drafting and Substance**

The Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (AEIC) is the vessel through which evidence is introduced in Singapore civil trials. It replaces oral examination-in-chief, designed to expedite the trial process. However, the preparation of an AEIC is a minefield of potential procedural defects.

### **3.1 Drafting Principles: The "Own Words" Doctrine**

A recurrent issue in litigation is the "over-lawyered" affidavit. The Practice Directions and recent case law emphasize that an affidavit must reflect the witness's own evidence.

- **Independent Recollection:** The evidence must be the witness's independent testimony. Coaching—where a lawyer suggests answers or aligns the witness's evidence with others—is strictly prohibited and can lead to the evidence being disregarded or the lawyer facing disciplinary action.10
- **Language:** The affidavit must be drafted in the witness's own words. While lawyers structure the document, the phrasing should reflect the witness's voice. If a witness is not fluent in English, the affidavit should ideally be interpreted to them in their native language before affirmation.8
- **Personal Knowledge:** The deponent must state identifying details (address, occupation) and explicitly confirm which facts are within their personal knowledge and which are based on information and belief (stating the source).11

### **3.2 Technical Formatting Requirements (Supreme Court & State Courts)**

Uniformity in formatting is critical for the court's digitization efforts. The **Supreme Court Practice Directions 2021 (Part 10\)** and **State Courts Practice Directions 2021 (Part VIII)** impose identical strictures.8

#### **3.2.1 The Physical and Digital Layout**

- **Form:** All affidavits must follow **Form 31** of Appendix A.8
- **Margins:** A blank margin of not less than **35mm** on all four sides is mandatory. This facilitates binding and the inclusion of court stamps without obscuring text.8
- **Pagination:** Every page, including separators and exhibits, must be numbered consecutively at the top right-hand corner. Crucially, the hard copy pagination _must_ match the PDF pagination in the electronic file exactly.14
- **Font and Spacing:** Text must be double-spaced (for readability during cross-examination) and use a minimum font size of **Times New Roman 12**. Single spacing is permitted only for:
  - Headings and footers.
  - Long quotations or extracts of transcripts.
  - Tables of contents.8

#### **3.2.2 The Identification Header**

To prevent confusion in multi-party suits, a specific header is required on the top right-hand corner of the first page 8:

\[Party\];; \[Ordinal Number\];  
Example: 1st Claimant; Lim Siew Lan; 2nd; 24.01.2025

#### **3.2.3 Photograph Requirement**

For Originating Claims, a colour photograph of the deponent must be affixed to the top left-hand corner of the first page. This rule, introduced in ROC 2021, aims to prevent identity fraud and assist the court in identifying witnesses.2

### **3.3 Managing Exhibits**

Exhibits are often the source of greatest confusion and error.

- **Marking:** Exhibits must be marked with the deponent’s initials and a sequential number (e.g., "LSL-1"). If the same deponent files a second affidavit, the numbering must continue (e.g., starting at "LSL-15" if the first ended at 14).8
- **Table of Contents:** If there are more than 10 exhibits, a table of contents is mandatory before the first exhibit.14
- **Dividers:** Colored dividers must be used in hard copies (Red for Claimants, Blue for Defendants) to aid visual navigation.13
- **Non-Documentary Exhibits:** Physical evidence (e.g., a hard drive, a prototype) must be clearly labeled and, if small, placed in a sealed transparent container. An enlarged photograph of the object should be included in the body of the affidavit.8

## **4\. Court-Specific Practice Directions: A Comparative Analysis**

While the rules are largely harmonized, specific nuances exist between the Supreme Court, State Courts, and Family Justice Courts.

### **4.1 The Supreme Court (High Court & Appellate Division)**

The Supreme Court handles claims exceeding $250,000 and complex matters. Its Practice Directions (Part 10\) are the most comprehensive regarding complex evidence.8

- **Single Application Pending Trial (SAPT):** The Supreme Court enforces a strict "one-shot" rule for interlocutory applications. Parties must file all applications (discovery, interrogatories, evidence admissibility) in a single block 21 days after the Case Conference. Affidavits supporting these applications are exchanged strictly within 21-day windows.2
- **Foreign Evidence:** Part 10 specifically details the 8-week lead time required for applying for evidence via live video link from abroad, emphasizing the need to check foreign laws.8

### **4.2 The State Courts (District & Magistrates' Courts)**

Handling claims below $250,000, the State Courts focus on volume and speed.

- **Simplified Proceedings:** For lower-value claims, simplified tracks limit the length of affidavits and the number of witnesses to reduce costs, aligning with the "Proportionality" Ideal.13
- **Panel of Experts:** The State Courts maintain a specific panel of experts for certain recurring issues (e.g., motor accident valuation) to streamline expert evidence.13
- **Binding Colors:** Specific mandates for plastic ring binding colors (Red/Blue) are explicitly enforced to allow judges to distinguish bundles instantly on the bench.14

### **4.3 The Family Justice Courts (FJC)**

The _Family Justice Rules 2024_ create a distinct ecosystem focused on therapeutic justice.

- **The Originating Application (OA):** Unlike civil claims, family matters (divorce, guardianship) commence via OA supported immediately by an affidavit. This "front-loads" the evidence.16
- **Form 54 (Generic Affidavit):** A standardized template is used to guide self-represented litigants and lawyers alike, ensuring all necessary fields (income, assets, children) are covered.12
- **First Ancillary Affidavit (Form 15):** In divorce ancillary matters (division of assets), this specific form compels parties to disclose assets in a structured table format, reducing the ability to hide assets in dense text.17
- **Sensitive Information:** FJC rules are stricter regarding the redaction of children's personal details and the non-disclosure of safehouse addresses in Personal Protection Order cases.18

## **5\. Witness Management: From Subpoena to the Stand**

Securing the attendance of witnesses is a critical logistical task.

### **5.1 Orders to Attend Court (Form 29\)**

The subpoena is now styled as an "Order to Attend Court."

- **Issuance:** Parties must file a Request using **Form 29**.8 The order is only valid once sealed.
- **Arbitration:** For proceedings outside the court (e.g., SIAC arbitration), the process remains physical—a hard copy request must be brought to the Registry for sealing.8
- **Release:** A common pitfall is assuming a witness is released after cross-examination. The PDs state that a witness is released _unless_ counsel specifically applies for them to remain (e.g., for recall).8

### **5.2 Remote Testimony**

Post-pandemic, remote testimony is common but regulated.

- **Application:** Must be made **8 weeks** prior to the hearing.
- **foreign Objections:** The applicant bears the burden of proving that the foreign territory (e.g., China, Switzerland) allows the taking of evidence. Some jurisdictions view voluntary depositions as a violation of sovereignty.8

## **6\. The Digital Courtroom: eLitigation Compliance**

Singapore’s eLitigation system is the backbone of the judiciary. It is not merely a file repository but a case management system.

### **6.1 Technical Specifications for Filing**

- **PDF Formatting:** All documents must be converted to PDF (not scanned, if possible) to allow for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and text searching.15
- **File Naming:** Files must be named logically to aid the judge. While strict naming conventions like "CODE_Party" are less explicit than in some jurisdictions, best practice dictates names like \- AEIC of \[Name\] \- \[Party\] to ensure chronological sorting.
- **Resolution:** Scanned documents must be legible. High-resolution scanning (300 DPI) is recommended, but file size limits (often 10MB or 20MB per chunk) must be observed.19

### **6.2 Service Bureau**

For litigants without SingPass or law firms facing technical outages, the Service Bureau acts as a physical interface. Documents submitted here are digitized by staff. The "4:00 PM Rule" applies: documents submitted before 4:00 PM are processed same-day; those after are processed the next working day.20

## **7\. Oaths, Affirmations, and Remote Commissioning**

The validity of an affidavit rests on the solemnity of the oath.

### **7.1 The Role of the Commissioner for Oaths (CFO)**

Affidavits must be sworn before a CFO who is independent of the solicitors acting for the party.21

- **Fees:** The fees are statutory and non-negotiable: **$25 per affidavit** and **$5 per exhibit**.21
- **Interpretation:** If the deponent does not understand English, the CFO (or a qualified interpreter) must interpret the contents. The jurat must strictly reflect this interpretation; failure to do so renders the affidavit inadmissible.8

### **7.2 Remote Commissioning**

Practice Directions now permanently allow remote swearing via video link.

- **Protocol:** The deponent and CFO must both be in Singapore. The deponent shows their NRIC to the camera. They sign the document in view of the CFO. The document is then couriered to the CFO for their signature.
- **Jurat Modification:** The jurat must state: _"Affirmed remotely on in Singapore via live video link..."_.8

## **8\. The Ecosystem of Singapore Legal Resources**

For the practitioner seeking to verify these rules or find the relevant forms, the Singapore legal ecosystem offers several authoritative digital repositories.

### **8.1 LawNet (Singapore Academy of Law)**

- **URL:** [https://www.lawnet.sg](https://www.lawnet.sg)
- **Function:** This is the premier legal research database. It contains the _Singapore Law Reports_, unreported judgments, and comprehensive legislation. It is the authoritative source for citing binding precedents in court.
- **Utility:** Essential for checking if a specific evidentiary rule has been interpreted recently by the Court of Appeal.

### **8.2 Singapore Statutes Online (SSO)**

- **URL:** [https://sso.agc.gov.sg](https://sso.agc.gov.sg)
- **Function:** The official government repository for legislation.
- **Utility:** Practitioners use this to access the current version of the _Evidence Act 1893_ and _Rules of Court 2021_. It is free and updated in real-time.

### **8.3 The Law Society of Singapore**

- **URL:** [https://www.lawsociety.org.sg](https://www.lawsociety.org.sg)
- **Function:** Provides practice support, ethics guidance, and the directory of lawyers.
- **Utility:** The "Ethics Assist" helpline is crucial for lawyers facing dilemmas about witness coaching or disclosure duties. The site also hosts the _Practice Directions_ for the Law Society itself.23

### **8.4 eLitigation**

- **URL:** [https://www.elitigation.sg](https://www.elitigation.sg)
- **Function:** The filing portal.
- **Utility:** Beyond filing, it offers the "Cause Book Search" to check the status of cases and access the "Pack 1" and "Pack 2" court forms.

## **9\. Conclusion**

The landscape of evidence and procedure in Singapore is defined by a tension between rigid formalism and the equitable "Ideals" of justice. For the practitioner, success lies in mastering the technical details—the 35mm margin, the precise wording of a hearsay notice, the resolution of a PDF—while never losing sight of the broader objective: the fair and expeditious resolution of disputes.

Non-compliance is no longer a mere irregularity; under the ROC 2021, it is a potential breach of the fundamental Ideals of the justice system. By adhering to the comprehensive guidelines set out in the Practice Directions and the Evidence Act, counsel ensures that their client's case is heard on its merits, unimpeded by procedural friction.
