### Part 2: Meta-Description of Formatting

This document appears to be a legal **Index to a Bundle of Documents** for a High Court case in Singapore. Here are the specific formatting characteristics:

- **Structure:**
- **Title Page:** Standard legal header listing the court division, case number, parties involved (Claimant vs. Defendants), and the title of the bundle.
- **Solicitors Table:** A 3-column table immediately following the title page listing the law firms representing each party, specific lawyers' names, office addresses, and file references.
- **Main Index:** A structured table containing the list of documents included in the bundle.

- **Table Layout:**
- **Columns:** The main index uses a 3-column layout (sometimes 4 if counting the item number):

1. **No. / Date:** (Often combined or split) Chronological date of the document.
2. **Description:** A detailed title of the document (e.g., "Statement of Claim," "Letter from X to Y").
3. **Page:** The page range within the physical bundle (e.g., "474 - 479").

- **Borders:** Visible grid lines separate all rows and columns.

- **Categorization:**
- The index is divided into logical sections labeled with letters (A, B, C...) and bold headings (e.g., **A. Last pleadings of the Parties**).
- Tabs are explicitly referenced (e.g., **(TAB A)**).
- Sub-sections are numbered (e.g., **1. Agreements**, **2. Business Profile**).

- **Page Numbering:**
- **Index Pagination:** The index pages themselves are numbered independently from the bundle contents. For example, "4" is visible at the top right of the invoice list page, indicating it is page 4 of the Index itself.
- **Bundle Pagination:** The "Page" column refers to a continuous pagination sequence for the evidentiary documents (starting from page 6 in the provided images).

- **Typography:**
- **Font:** A standard sans-serif font (likely Arial or Calibri).
- **Emphasis:** Bold text is used for section headers, party names in agreements (e.g., **"Kunlun"**), and column headers.
- **Alignment:** Dates and Page numbers are generally left-aligned or center-aligned; Descriptions are left-aligned.
